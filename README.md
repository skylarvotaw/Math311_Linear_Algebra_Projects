# Math311_Linear_Algebra_Projects

This is a repository of projects for the Math 311 linear algebra course at Winona State University. It uses google colab and coding in python to explore linear algebra concepts 

# Projects:

1. Solve systems using Colab and python

Using Google Co-lab to introduce the idea of solving systems of equations with code.
